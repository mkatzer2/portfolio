      <p>Monica is currently an undergradute student at the University of Washington Seattle. She will be graduating in June 2015 with a Bachelor's Degree in Japanese and a certificate in Web Development. She was introduced to Japanese at a young age through family members in Japan and has grown to love both the country and it's language and culture. She has taken courses in advanced Japanese throughout her time at UW and has maintained a very high grade point average.</p>
      <p>Her passion for coding made it's spark late in her college career when she took CSE 143 (Introduction to Java Programming). Being able to type code and then see the product right before her really got her interested in coding. With html, she enjoys the exhilaration of figuring out how to use a new tag or finally finding the solution for an error. Even more so, she loves to be able to put someone's idea into a fully functional website.</p>
        <p>In early 2015, she decided to take part in UW's Professional and Continuing Education, through the certificate program for web development.The program offers extensive insight into various fundemental components of web development including html, css, and JavaScript. Although it is still quite early to tell, she has been enjoying her time in the program and has high hopes that it will open up a whole new world of opportunities for her.</p>
      <p>In her spare time, Monica likes to take part in various activities. She is an active member of the Japanese Student Association as well as volunteering for a local international exchange program in Seattle. Besides school realted acitivities, Monica also enjoys sewing, snowboarding, playing guitar, and photography/film. </p>
