            <p>Outside of world of web development, one of my biggest hobbies is working with the camera. </p>
            <p>My favorite type of photography would probably have to nature photography. I love to take pictures of plants, animals, scenic roads, candid photos of strangers, etc. Many of the photos below are from my trips to Japan as well as outings to local Seattle hotspots.</p>
            <p>In addtion to photography, I have recently picked up a new hobbie: film. In particular I have been working on some music videos with people I know. I also took a film class last quarter at UW which allowed me to better understand, lighting, aperature, lense choice, etc. For any of you out there who are UW students, I definitely recommend the class!

It's not actually my own camera so unfortunately I will have to give it back to my dad eventually... but for the mean time I've been trying to take as much advantage of it while I still have it. I don't too much about the specifics, but I LOVE THIS CAMERA. It takes such beautiful, clear pictures with so much definition in them. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a nice DSLR!</p>

              <h3>Fushimi Inari Taisha</h3>
              <p>This temple has become more and more popular lately for it's beautiful orange gates. I woke up early that morning to get a glimpse of the temples in Tokyo. Lucky for me I made it just in time to climb to the top and back before any of the tourists came in. Surprisingly, this was taken on my iphone!</p>

              <p>These umbrellas were so beautiful! The lights behind them are actually in water so I was surprised I was able to get a nice shot like this. This picture was taken in the Enoshima Caves in Japan.</p>
